# KillMicrosoftApps
This script simply kills Teams and Microsoft Edge and then starts TXSecureBrowser in one double-click.

The .ico file is included to make the batch file look identical to TXSecureBrowser, thus creating a seamless workaround for users. In order to change the file icon, you will need to create a shortcut to the batch file and change the icon of the shortcut.
